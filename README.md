$ cd NotesApp
$ npm install zustand
```

Create your project structure, including components, screens, and navigation.


React Native notes app with CRUD operations using the Zustand state management library, here's a concise documentation specifying the commands used for each step of the development process. This documentation assumes that you have a basic understanding of React Native and Zustand.

step-1 Create a Notes Store

Create a file for your Zustand store, e.g., Store.ts.
 
Implemented set and get in Zustand store

step-2 Create a Note Component

Create a new Note component, e.g., Note.ts.

Use the Zustand store to access and modify the state for each note.

step-3 Create a List of Notes Component
Create a component to display a list of notes, e.g., Notes.tsx.

Use the Zustand store to access the list of notes and map them to the UI

step-4 Implement Create Operation
Create a component or screen for adding a new note, e.g., CreateNote.tsx.

Use the Zustand store to add a new note to the state

step-5 Implement Update Operation
Use the Zustand store to update the note's content.

step-6 Implement Delete Operation
Implement a delete function using Zustand to remove a note from the state

step-7 Styling and Navigation
Style your components using CSS or a styling library.
Implement navigation using React Navigation or a similar library to navigate between screens.

step-8 Testing
Test your app on both iOS and Android emulators/simulators and physical devices.
Debug and fix any issues that may arise.
